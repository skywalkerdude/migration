grape vine","lang":"english","lyrics":"1\nLet us contemplate the grape vine,\nFrom its life now let us learn,\nHow its growth is fraught with suff'ring,\nMidst environment so stern;\nHow unlike the untamed flowers\nGrowing in the wilderness\nIn a maze of wild confusion,\nMaking patterns numberless.\n\n2\nBut the blossoms of the grape vine\nWithout glory are and small;\nThough they do have some expression,\nThey are hardly seen withal.\nBut a day since they have flowered\nInto fruit the blooms have grown;\nNever may they wave corollas\nWith luxuriant beauty shown.\n\n3\nTo a post the vine is fastened;\nThus it cannot freely grow;\nWhen its branches are extended,\nTo the trellis tied they go.\nTo the stony soil committed,\nDrawing thence its food supply;\nIt can never choose its own way,\nOr from difficulty fly.\n\n4\nOh, how beautiful its verdure,\nWhich in spring spread o'er the field.\nFrom life's energy and fulness\nGrowth abundant doth it yield.\nTill it's full of tender branches\nTwining freely everywhere,\nStretching 'gainst the sky's deep azure\nTasting sweetly of the air.\n\n5\nBut the master of the vineyard\nNot in lenience doth abide,\nBut with knife and pruning scissors\nThen would strip it of its pride.\nCaring not the vine is tender,\nBut with deep, precision stroke\nAll the pretty, excess branches\nFrom the vine are neatly broke.\n\n6\nIn this time of loss and ruin,\nDare the vine self-pity show?\nNay, it gives itself more fully\nTo the one who wounds it so,\nTo the hand that strips its branches,\nTill of beauty destitute,\nThat its life may not be wasted,\nBut preserved for bearing fruit.\n\n7\nInto hard wood slowly hardens\nEvery stump of bleeding shoot,\nEach remaining branch becoming\nClusters of abundant fruit.\nThen, beneath the scorching sunshine,\nLeaves are dried and from it drop;\nThus the fruit more richly ripens\nTill the harvest of the crop.\n\n8\nBowed beneath its fruitful burden,\nLoaded branches are brought low—\nLabor of its growth thru suff'ring\nMany a purposed, cutting blow.\nNow its fruit is fully ripened,\nComforted the vine would be;\nBut the harvest soon is coming,\nAnd its days of comfort flee.\n\n9\nHands will pick and feet will trample\nAll the riches of the vine,\nTill from out the reddened wine-press\nFlows a river full of wine.\nAll the day its flow continues,\nBloody-red, without alloy,\nGushing freely, richly, sweetly,\nFilling all the earth with joy.\n\n10\nIn appearance now the grape vine\nBarren is and pitiful;\nHaving given all, it enters\nInto night inscrutable.\nNo one offers to repay it\nFor the cheering wine that's drunk,\nBut 'tis stripped and cut e'en further\nTo a bare and branchless trunk\n\n11\nYet its wine throughout the winter\nWarmth and sweetness ever bears\nUnto those in coldness shiv'ring,\nPressed with sorrow, pain, and cares.\nYet without, alone, the grape vine\nMidst the ice and snow doth stand,\nSteadfastly its lot enduring,\nThough 'tis hard to understand.\n\n12\nWinter o'er, the vine prepareth\nFruit again itself to bear;\nBudding forth and growing branches,\nBeauteous green again to wear;\nNever murmuring or complaining\nFor the winter's sore abuse,\nOr for all its loss desiring\nIts fresh off'ring to reduce.\n\n13\nBreathing air, untainted, heavenly,\nAs it lifts its arms on high,\nEarth's impure, defiled affections\nNe'er the vine may occupy.\nFacing sacrifice, yet smiling,\nAnd while love doth prune once more,\nStrokes it bears as if it never\nSuffered loss and pain before.\n\n14\nFrom the branches of the grape vine\nSap and blood and wine doth flow.\nDoes the vine, for all it suffered,\nLost, and yielded, poorer grow?\nDrunkards of the earth and wanderers,\nFrom it drink and merry make,\nFrom their pleasure and enjoyment\nDo they richer thereby wake?\n\n15\nNot by gain our life is measured,\nBut by what we've lost 'tis scored;\n'Tis not how much wine is drunken,\nBut how much has been outpoured.\nFor the strength of love e'er standeth\nIn the sacrifice we bear;\nHe who has the greatest suff'ring\nEver has the most to share.\n\n16\nHe who treats himself severely\nIs the best for God to gain;\nHe who hurts himself most dearly\nMost can comfort those in pain.\nHe who suffering never beareth\nIs but empty \"sounding brass\";\nHe who self-life never spareth\nHas the joys which all surpass.\n"},{"id":2316,"title":"And there, there I will meet with you","lang":"english","lyrics":"# Capo 3\nAnd [D]there, there I will [Bm]meet with you \nAnd I will [G]speak with you\nAbove the

His Bride, His own.\n\n8\nLord, keep us poor in spirit, pure in heart that we may be\nGood ground in which the seed of life may grow abundantly,\nUntil the final stage is reached and You are

Lord, the Spirit,\nUs transforming every day.\n\n6\nGod the Father (in this fourth step),\nSource of life, is gold divine;\nChrist the Son was wounded by us\nTo produce the pearl so fine.\nGod the Spirit brings the stones forth—\nTransformation of the clay.\nBy the flowing of the Spirit\nChanged we'll be from day to day.\n\n7\nInsufficient are materials\nPrecious though they be and best;\nThese must be built up together\nThat God's house they may express.\nFifth step: We ourselves hand over\nTo the building that we be\nBuilt into God's house, His dwelling,\nOne in each locality.\n\n8\nFinally, in Revelation,\nIs the picture of Christ's Bride—\nConsummation of God's purpose;\nHe is fully satisfied.\nNew Jerusalem, a city,\nIs the Bridegroom's counterpart—\nSo the church built up together\nForms the Bride for Christ's own heart.\n\n9\nHow can we, as those who truly\nLong to see God reach His goal,\nBe united and related?\nBy denial of our soul!\nAs we contact Christ in spirit,\nFeed on Him as life to us,\nThen His life will flow, transform us\nTo His Bride, all glorious!\n"},{"id":3462,"title":"As the world rushes on","lang":"english","lyrics":"#Capo

wachsen,\nLieblich grün ist nun sein Kleid;\nEr beklagt sich nie und murrt nicht,\nDass der Winter schmerzhaft war;\nTrotz Verlust will er sein Opfer\nNicht vermindern dieses Jahr.\n\n13\nWährend er die Arme ausstreckt,\nLuft einatmet, himmlisch rein,\nNein, was irdisch ist und unrein,\nNimmt den Weinstock niemals ein.\nOpfer bringt er, doch er lächelt,\nDenn in Liebe ist der Schnitt,\nSchläge trägt er, als ob niemals\nEr zuvor Verlust erlitt.\n\n14\nAus den Reben dieses Weinstocks\nFließt sein Saft, sein Blut und Wein.\nWird sein Wachstum durch viel Leiden\nUnd Verlust je ärmer sein?\nTrunkenbolde auf der Erde\nSchenken übermäßig ein.\nWerden sie durch viel Vergnügen\nUnd Genuss je reicher sein?\n\n15\nUnser Leben wird gemessen\nNach Verlust, nicht nach Gewinn;\nWie viel Wein wir trinken, zählt nicht,\nDoch wie viel wir geben hin.\nDenn im Opfer, das wir bringen,\nIst die Liebe stark fürwahr;\nWer durch tiefstes Leid gegangen,\nReicht am meisten Leben dar.\n\n16\nNur wer streng mit sich selbst umgeht,\nIst Gewinn für unsren Gott;\nWer Verletzungen erduldet,\nKann die trösten, die in Not.\nWer das Leiden niemals annimmt,\nNur wie leere Bronze klingt;\nWer sein Seelenleben hingibt,\nGrößte Freude ihn durchdringt.\n"},{"id":3147,"title":"Kein Tod das Auferstehungsleben hält","lang":"Deutsch","lyrics":"\n1\nKein Tod das Auferstehungsleben hält\nDenn Gottes

breath of life in\nTo a man created like Him.\nAs they walked along the way\nIn the coolness of the day\nThe intent was still within the heart of God.\n\n3\nMan surveyed what God made\nGiving names, but he never came\nTo a mate, and he ached for a counterpart.\nHe could taste the ’ternal yearning\nThat so long in God was burning!\nEve was built from Adam’s side\nAnd his heart was satisfied;\nTold the story of the hidden heart of God.\n\n4\nBut when Eve was deceived\nWhat was pure fell beyond a cure.\nDead to God through the dread serpent’s subtlety.\nLeft creation in a quandary!\nGenerations lived in mystery!\nSeeking Job could not perceive\nBut persisted to believe\nThere was purpose in the hidden heart of God.\n\n5\nIn the time He designed\nHe was born of a virgin’s womb\nTo reveal what was sealed from eternity.\nHe was born in human history\nTo reveal its greatest mystery.\nThat the answer for the earth\nWas that Christ so loved the church.\nHe would die to satisfy the heart of God.\n\n6\nAs the throne had foreknown\nMany men were deceived again\nThrough the lies they devised\nHe was crucified.\nAs the lonely grain was falling\nStill the joy before was calling;\nBlood and water from His side\nWould redeem and build His bride.\nShe would satisfy the riven heart of God.\n\n7\nThough His death’s final breath,\nFinally fell, He could not be held\nFor His life was divine and unbreakable.\nHe arises, powers hear it!\nHe will court her as the Spirit!\nAs the Spirit giving life\nHe will find and form His wife.\nShe will satisfy the living heart of God.\n\n8\nWhen He breathed, she received\nHis divine personality,\nMoving in, washing sin, death and age away.\nSo that He might sanctify her\nBy the washing of the water!\nAdding beauty, adding health\nTo present her to Himself\nAnd to satisfy the holy heart of God.\n\n9\nIn a time beyond time,\nIn an age beyond the ages,\nGod and man will be one for eternity.\nHallelujah, what a story!\nShe was brought from gloom to glory!\nAnd the longing from the start\nFor a bride, a counterpart\nIs fulfilled inside the happy heart of God."},{"id":3695,"title":"La voix de Jésus j'entendis","lang":"français","lyrics":"1\nLa
